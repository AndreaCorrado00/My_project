// My idea of how can we use these link
// A widget (algrthm) with the 'Goal-curiosity of the day'
// Proving a way to read the current date and to convert the current date into a number between 1 and 17
// The widget (HomePage) could show a certain costant text and a mutable text wich is inside this databese. Than there is a link to the page
